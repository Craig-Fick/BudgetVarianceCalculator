# Budget-Variance-Calculator

# INTRO

This tool can be used to plug in a work schedule and examine hours/pay/overtime quickly.


CONTEXT

   The tools I had as a manager at the time of creating this were lacking. I could view the current hours and calculate everything or I could wait to every twelve hours to see my updated budged hours and pay. This application allowed me to calculate the information quickly. It states who is under/over on hours, who has overtime, and where I am at in terms of budgeted pay. If I was under on hours or given additional budget for overtime, I could also plug in additional hours for specific employees to see where the budget will be if they should work in the future. 


TUTORIAL

   For this build, I built in a basic one week schedule along with pay rates for five employees to test the program out with. This would not be hard to alter to include more.
Here you can see the first page along with a sample of the data used.


On the next page, the tool can be examined. This is where a user would plug in the current hours of the employees and day of the scheduled period. You can not leave any entry blank. For example, if zero hours were worked then enter zero.



After entering the needed information, click "CALCULATE" and all of the information should populate.
